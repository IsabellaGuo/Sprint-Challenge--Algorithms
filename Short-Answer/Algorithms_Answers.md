#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
The runtime complexity of the code is O(n)

b)
O(nlogn). The inner while loop by itself would have a complexity of log(n), and the outer for loop by itself is O(n). So total complexity is O(nlogn)

c)
The recursive function calls itself. O(n)
## Exercise II
To minimize the number of dropped + broken eggs, I am going to start dropping eggs from the first floor. The first time the eggs breaks, f is equal to the floor number. This way will only cosume 1 broken egg to find the floor f. The runtime for this process is O(n).
